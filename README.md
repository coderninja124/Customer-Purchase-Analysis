# Customer Analysis Project

## Overview

This project explores sales data to help businesses make better decisions. Analyze sales trends, customer habits, and product performance using real data from Kaggle.

## What I Did

 Explored the data to see how sales change over time, grouped customers by shopping habits, and found key trends.

## What I Found

- **When People Buy**: Sales spike during holidays, especially in December.
  
- **Top Products**: Some products sell really well, showing high demand and potential for promotions.
  
- **Customer Types**: Identified different customer groups based on shopping behavior, which helps businesses target marketing and improve retention.

## What to Do Next

Based on my findings, here are actionable steps:

- Promote popular products during peak seasons like holidays.
- Ensure high-demand products are well-stocked during busy times.
- Enhance customer service to improve satisfaction and loyalty.
